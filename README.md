Wells Fargo Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage - February 2024

 * Understood relevant requirements for building a system to manage financial
   portfolios
 * Figured out what data the system needed to keep track of
 * Drafted a visual representation of the data as an entity relationship diagram
   (ERD)
 * Used the IntelliJ developer application to implement the ERD and published it
   to GitHub


 “Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Wells Fargo's Job Simulation on the Forage platform,
and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate
in a Software Engineering team at Wells Fargo.
I practiced using IntelliJ JPA developer and data model visualization skills in
a realistic context to learn more about building a system to support financial
advisors.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on data modeling and
system development and I'm excited to apply these skills in a Software
Engineering team at a company like Wells Fargo.
